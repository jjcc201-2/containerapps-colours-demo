# containerapps-colours-demo

## Description
Based on Mark Harrison's Container Apps hands-on lab https://markharrison.io/lab-azure-container-apps/

This project takes the step-by-step guide in Mark's hands-on lab and provides it as Terraform infrastructure-as-code, in order to quickly spin up & tear down the environment for demonstration purposes. Currently up to and including "Deploy APIApp"

## Setting Up the Project Locally

This project can be set up locally on:
1. Your local IDE
2. Visual Studio Code via Dev Container
3. A cloud developer environment through GitHub Codespaces.

Options 2 & 3 will have the correct extensions pre-installed for Terraform.
